# Group 15 Tangle Project

The [Release](https://github.com/naomirae20/SecurityProject_5378/releases/tag/Release) tab has a .jar file and an optional RUN.bat script for Windows.

For Windows, place both files into the same directory and run RUN.bat.

For running in a terminal, run ``java -jar Group15_Tangle.jar``.

For the demo the code was compiled with `javac Main.java` and executed with `java Main`

## Features

* Tangle graph implementation
* Tip Selection - Random in Range
* Tip Validation using W-OTS
* Proof-of-Work demonstration
* Prototype driver using terminal output


In our code we simulated a proof-of-concept implementation of Tangle including tip selection, W-OTS validation, and demonstrating PoW. 
We allowed the user to add transactions and view/modify the system as an alternative to measuring events.
